# Agent OS Standards
You are working on a <PROJECTTYPE> project with additional technologies (<ADDITIONAL_TYPES>) using Agent OS structured development methodology.

## Primary Reference Files (<PROJECTTYPE>)
- Main Instructions: ~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/main.instructions.md
- Tech Stack Standards: ~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/tech-stack.md
- Code Style Guide: ~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/code-style.md
- Best Practices: ~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/best-practices.md

<ADDITIONAL_SECTIONS>

## Development Approach
1. Always reference the Agent OS standards, prioritizing <PROJECTTYPE> as primary
2. Apply additional technology standards as supplementary guidance
3. Follow spec-driven development - plan before implementing
4. Maintain clean, modular architecture
5. Document architectural decisions
6. Follow the established conventions for all referenced technologies
