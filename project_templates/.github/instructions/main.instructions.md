1. **Plan First**: Always understand the full scope before coding

3. **Standards Compliance**: Follow the <PROJECTTYPE> standards primarily, with guidance from additional technologies
4. **Modular Design**: Maintain separation of concerns and clean architecture



## Agent OS Workflows



## Important Notes

- Primary standards from `~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/main.instructions.md` take precedence
- Additional technology standards provide supplementary guidance
- Project-specific files in this directory override global defaults
- Update Agent OS standards as you discover new patterns
