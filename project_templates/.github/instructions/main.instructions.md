## Project Context

This is a **<PROJECTTYPE>** project with additional technologies (<ADDITIONAL_TYPES>) using Agent OS structured development workflows.

## Primary Standards Reference (<PROJECTTYPE>)
- Main Instructions: `~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/main.instructions.md`
- Tech Stack Standards: `~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/tech-stack.md`
- Code Style Guide: `~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/code-style.md`
- Best Practices: `~/.agent-os/<PROJECTTYPE>/best-practices.md`

## Additional Technology Standards

<!-- Additional project type standards will be dynamically generated -->

## Development Guidelines

Please follow the Agent OS methodology:

1. **Plan First**: Always understand the full scope before coding
2. **Spec-Driven**: Create detailed specifications for complex features
3. **Standards Compliance**: Follow the <PROJECTTYPE> standards primarily, with guidance from additional technologies
4. **Modular Design**: Maintain separation of concerns and clean architecture
